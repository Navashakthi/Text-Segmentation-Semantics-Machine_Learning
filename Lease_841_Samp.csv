Upon the giving by Lessee of such notice, the term of this lease shall be automatically extended for said additional five (5) yearperiod without execution of any extension or renewal lease, each of such extensions, however, to be subject to the provisions hereinafter contained relating to additional rental and to all other terms, conditions and covenants herein contained. Lessee, upon failing to renew this lease for each of the periods  of time herein set forth,  consecutively, shall forfeit its right to further renewals, but the renewal of this lease for (1) or more of the periods of time herein set forth, consecutively, shall in no manner obligate or require Lessee to renew this lease for any or all remaining periods of time set forth in this Section.In the event any option to extend this lease for one or more additional five (5) year periods shall be exercised, then the Fixed Annual Rental set forth in Paragraph C of Section 9 hereof (the ""9C Annual Rental"") shall be increased during such extension period proportionately to reflect the decrease, if any, in the purchasing power of the dollar as of the beginning of such extension period as compared with the purchasing power of the dollar as of January 1, 1996, to the end that the purchasing power of the 9C Annual Rental payable during such extension period shall not be less than the purchasing power of the 9C Annual Rental as of January 1, 1996. For the purpose of this provision, the increase in the 9C Annual Rental, if any, shall be directly proportionate to the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average, All Items (1982-84=100) published by the United States Department of Labor, or its successor agency and shall be computed by multiplying the amount of the 9C Annual Rental by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be Consumer Price Index (afore identified) last published prior to the beginning of such extension period and the denominator of which shall be the Consumer Price Index (afore identified) last published priorto January 1, 1996. The adjusted Fixed Annual Rental (as determined afore) for each lease year during an option period shall be payable in equal monthly installments, each in the sum of one- twelfth (1112) of that adjusted Fixed Annual Rental, in advance and without demand, beginning as of the applicable lease year, and continuing regularly on the 1st day of each month thereafter until the adjusted Fixed Annual Rental for such lease year be paid.  After an option to extend be exercised by Lessee (if such is), Lessor accepts the responsibility of computing the adjusted Fixed Annual Rental (as provided afore) for such option period and notifying Lessee of the adjusted Fixed Annual Rental for the option period; however, neither the failure of the Lessor to so compute the adjusted Fixed Annual Rental for the option period or the failure to notify Lessee of the adjusted Fixed Annual Rental for the option period shall excuse Lessee (i) from making the installment payments of Fixed Annual Rental during the option period at the previous prevailing rate, nor (ii) from the payment of any deficiency in rental which accrued prior to the notification by Lessor to Lessee of the adjusted Fixed Annual Rental applicable during the option period.  Nevertheless,  should Lessor fail to notify Lessee of the adjusted Fixed Annual Rental applicable during an option period prior to the commencement thereof, then Lessee shall not be in default under this lease (i) with respect to any deficiency between Fixed Annual Rental paid by Lessee and that actually due until thirty (30) days after Lessee shall have received notice from Lessor of the adjusted Fixed Annual Rental for the applicable option period, and (ii) with respect to any installment of adjusted Fixed Annual Rental, until five (5) days after Lessee shall have received notice from Lessor of the adjusted Fixed Annual Rental for the applicable option period.
